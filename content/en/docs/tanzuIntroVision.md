## VMware's Vision for App and Cloud Modernization

Every organization is now defined by the digital services it delivers. From engaging customers with new experiences, to building new revenue opportunities, and driving digital-first touchpoints that protect and enable customers and communities, these services have never been more essential.

But transformation isn’t happening fast enough. While expectations are high, efforts are slowed or stalled by the complexity of existing apps, interdependencies with existing infrastructure, diversity across public clouds, and silos of infrastructure, operations and security. Nearly every organization can feel the tension between the opportunities tied to transformation and the daunting challenge of how to achieve it.
